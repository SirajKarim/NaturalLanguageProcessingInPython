NLP is a way for computers to analyze, understand, and derive meaning from human language in a smart and useful way.
       By utilizing NLP, developers can organize and structure knowledge to perform tasks such as automatic summarization, 
       translation, named entity recognition, relationship extraction, sentiment analysis, speech recognition, and topic 
       segmentation.Apart from common word processor operations that treat text like a mere sequence of symbols, NLP considers
       the hierarchical structure of language: several words make a phrase, several phrases make a sentence and, ultimately,
       sentences convey ideas,” John Rehling, an NLP expert at Meltwater Group,said in How Natural Language Processing Helps
       Uncover Social Media Sentiment. “By analyzing language for its meaning, NLP systems have long filled useful roles, 
       such as correcting grammar, converting speech to text and automatically translating between languages.NLP is used 
       to analyze text, allowing machines to understand how human’s speak. This human-computer interaction enables real-world 
       applications like automatic text summarization,sentiment analysis, topic extraction, named entity recognition, 
       parts-of-speech tagging, relationship extraction,stemming, and more. NLP is commonly used for text mining, machine 
       translation, and automated question answering.NLP is characterized as a hard problem in computer science. Human language
       is rarely precise, or plainly spoken.To understand human language is to understand not only the words, but the concepts 
       and how they’re linked together to create meaning. Despite language being one of the easiest things for humans to learn
       , the ambiguity of language is what makes natural language processing a difficult problem for computers to master.
